      <p>
        Happy birthday to my baby, my little princess,<br>
        my cute little munna who means the world to me.<br>
        Your radiance shines brighter than the sun,<br>
        yet your beauty feels calm and soft, like the moon.<br>
        You make everything around you warmer just by being you.<br><br>

        You are the calm inside my every day,<br>
        the quiet strength that lights my way.<br>
        In your smile, I find my peace,<br>
        in your laugh, my worries cease.<br><br>

        I want you to know, with all my heart,<br>
        that I’m here for you—right from the start.<br>
        Every fear, every tear you hide,<br>
        you can place them safely by my side.<br><br>

        I notice when you’re quiet, when you’re sad,<br>
        when your thoughts get busy and heavy.<br>
        I want you to remember you’re never alone—<br>
        leave the worries to me, trust me with them,<br>
        and just live your best, happiest life with me.<br><br>

        Trust me with the weight you carry,<br>
        your storms, your doubts—I won’t be wary.<br>
        I believe in us, I believe in you,<br>
        and I’ll do my best in all I do.<br><br>

        Our life is only just beginning,<br>
        so much is waiting for us ahead.<br>
        There will be highs, there will be challenges,<br>
        but together nothing feels impossible—<br>
        with you by my side, everything feels right.<br><br>

        You’re my safe place, my smile on hard days,<br>
        my soft comfort and my biggest strength.<br>
        And maybe a little trouble too—in the cutest way—<br>
        the kind that makes my heart beat faster<br>
        and my world feel brighter.<br><br>

        Today is about you, my baby,<br>
        about how incredible you are<br>
        and how grateful I am to love you—<br>
        today, tomorrow, and always.<br><br>

        When the world feels heavy or unfair,<br>
        please remember I’ll always care.<br>
        I’ll listen, stay, and help you through,<br>
        because your happiness means everything to me, too.<br><br>

        You’re never alone, not for a day,<br>
        as long as I’m standing here this way.<br>
        I love you deeply, more than words can say,<br>
        and I’ll keep choosing you—every single day. <br>
